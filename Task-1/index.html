        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            On 28th September 1907, he was born in Banga village of Punjab (now in Pakistan) into a Sikh family. His father was Kishan Singh, and his mother was called Vidyavati Kaur. During his birth, his father and uncles were serving jail sentences for demonstrating against the colonisation bill passed by the British in 1906. The politically infused environment in the family kindled the light of patriotism in the heart of boy Bhagat Singh. Very soon, he joined the Non-Cooperation Movement started by Mahatma Gandhi. He burnt the government. sponsored books. He completed his education at DAV high school and Lahore National College, Lahore. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 and the 1921 killing of Akali protestors at Nankana Sahib affected him immensely. Initially, like his family, Bhagat Singh had faith in the Gandhian ideology of non-violence to attain swaraj, but such incidents changed his belief.
